# Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my own personal website [lukehays.com](https://lukehays.com/). My previous site was a simple static page hosted on an S3 bucket, but I decided to build something more complex with a few additional features, such as a portfolio section and a blog.

The goal with this website is not only to have a convenient place to host my portfolio but also to help motivate learning new development concepts. To that end, I've picked a few pieces of technology that I'm not familiar with, but feel they would be easy to pick up and run with:

    Frontend Framework: Astro
    CSS: Tailwind
    E2E Testing: Playwright
    CI/CD: GitHub Actions
    Hosting: Cloudflare Pages

I doubt this project will need anything that requires an API, but who knows. My usual tech stack would involve React, but I've felt a need to move away from that for a while and hope this will serve as a good starting point.
